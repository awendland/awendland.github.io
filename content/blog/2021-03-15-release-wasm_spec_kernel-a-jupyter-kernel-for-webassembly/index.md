Testing out WebAssembly features that are only present in [webassembly/spec](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/tree/master/interpreter)'s reference interpreter is hard because the interpreter is written in OCaml and can't be run on the web.

So I created a Jupyter kernel that interfaces with its REPL. Now you showcase WebAssembly code in a Jupyter environment.

You can jump right into a web-based Jupyter notebook with this kernel loaded thanks to Binder:
